Introduction to Machine Learning and Pattern Recognition Final Project

Analyze a data set of all NFL games outcomes since the year 2000. 

Specifically, we started with the preprocessed generated from this github repository: https://github.com/ukritw/nflprediction. 

Our goal was to see if an *artificial neural network* could approach the *Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM)* estimate for this data to predict the outcome of each game.
